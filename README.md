## Data Collection
The data for this project is collected through web scraping techniques, focusing on extracting information from websites listing houses for sale in Medellin, Colombia. Various attributes such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and garages, along with the price, are scraped and used for further analysis.

## Data Manipulation and Analysis
Once the data is collected, it undergoes manipulation and analysis processes to prepare it for modeling. This includes handling missing values, exploring distributions of features through histograms, examining correlations between variables, and removing outliers to improve model performance.

## Machine Learning Models
The project employs two main machine learning models for predicting house prices:
- **Linear Regression**: A classic regression technique used to establish linear relationships between the features and the target variable.
- **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting algorithm known for its effectiveness in handling complex datasets and producing accurate predictions.
